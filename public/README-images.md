# Image Assets Required

The Little Lemon Restaurant app requires several image assets. Please add the following images to the public directory:

1. `little-lemon-logo.png` - The Little Lemon restaurant logo (showing in the header)
2. `hero-image.jpg` - Image of a dish for the hero section
3. `greek-salad.jpg` - Image of Greek Salad
4. `bruschetta.jpg` - Image of Bruschetta
5. `grilled-fish.jpg` - Image of Grilled Fish

You can either:
1. Use your own images and rename them to match the names above
2. Find royalty-free stock images
3. Create placeholder images with services like https://placeholder.com

The app is looking for these files in the public directory, so they should be placed directly in the `/public` folder.
